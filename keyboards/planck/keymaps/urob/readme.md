## Keymap configuration for OLKB Planck

- modifiers on home row
- layer switches on thumb keys
- base, num and nav layers are mapped to almost vanilla Miryoku
- all symbols and various desktop shortcuts can be reached from the base layer via combos
- the middle two columns do mostly nothing (except for a num lock on row 1)
- the bottom left key is mapped to undo/redo which I can bump comfortably with my palm while having my hands on the home row
- the bottom right two keys are mouse wheel up/down for hands-off-keyboard browsing and for advancing slides while giving presentations
- the greek layer has shift keys mapped to their respective mods, so that holding down both mods simultaneously yields shifted versions

## Combos

- the arrangement is optimized for mathematical coding and typesetting with
  latex
- vertical top row symbols follow mostly the standard num row arrangement
  (except + and & which are swapped, reflecting my frequency of use)
- vertical bottom row symbols are arranged to match the top row for easier
  memorization (^ and _,
  reflecting their triggering of super and subscripts in latex; + and -, * and
  /, and logical & and or |)
- holding down both index fingers (t + n) activates caps word (a smart caps lock
  that deactivates itself at the end of the word)

## Requirements

The configuration requires the following commits merged into the local QMK
branch. All requirements are satisfied when forking this branch

- Bilateral combinations branch
- Early combination branch
