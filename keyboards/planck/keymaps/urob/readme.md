# Keymap configuration for OLKB Planck

- base, num and nav layers are mapped to almost vanilla Miryoku (including home row mods)
- all symbols and various desktop shortcuts can be reached from the base layer via combos
- the middle two columns do mostly nothing (except for a num lock on row 1)
- the bottom left key is mapped to undo/redo which I can bump comfortably with my palm while having my hands on the home row
- the bottom right two keys are mouse wheel up/down for hands-off-keyboard browsing and for advancing slides while giving presentations
- the lock-key switches to a one-shot greek layer for mathematical typesetting (I can reach it semi-comfortably with my left thumb, but will probably switch to a combo-activation)

# Requirements

The configuration requires the following commits merged into the local QMK
branch. All requirements are satisfied when forking this branch

- Bilateral combinations branch
- Early combination branch
